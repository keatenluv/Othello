# An Intelligent Othello Player
Repo for Aritfical Intelligence assigment at University

Our Assignment was to program an "Intelligent Othello player"
To create this intelligent agent I used the **Minimax** algorithm with **Alpha Beta Pruning** to increase efficiency.

Currently, the agent is not very intelligent. It can play the game. However, it is not difficult to defeat.
By tuning the heuristic function used in minimax the preformance of the agent can be increased. 

The game is ran through the controller.py file in the command line:
'''
python3 controller.py
'''
